## About R script
File with R code "gettingdata_project.R" perform 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work)


## The original data was transformed by

1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


## About variables:   
* `train_set`, `test_set` contain the data from the downloaded files: X_test and X_train .
   It contains the features for the experiment.
*  `train_labels`, `test_lables` contain the data from the downloaded files: Y_test and Y_train.
    It contains the Names for the experiment.
* `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files: Subject_test and Subject_train.
    It contains the Subject_Id for the experiment.
* `sets_data`, `labels_data` and `subjects_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
*  all_data merge the previous  three datasets to further analysis
* `features` contains the correct names for the `Set_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
